                Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!! 
                Rachel?
                No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
                No!!
                No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
                What?
                She was...
                She, she was different.
                Nobody likes change.
                What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
                I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
                Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
                Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
                That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
                Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
                Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
                Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
                Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
                ..Yes I would.
                ...Yes.
                La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.
                What, now you’re not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!
                Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
                That’s what?!
                Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
                Okay, okay, okay.

                I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
                Just get away from me!
                A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
                Ross, you had sex with another woman!
                Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
                Just get out! Now!!
                Okay! All right! How was she?
                Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?
                Good different?
                Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
                And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
                We were on a break!
                You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
                Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
                God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
                Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
                All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
                You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
                You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
                That’s....
                That is neither here nor there.
                No Ross!! Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
